    "# Optimising compute with concurrent IO in OpenCL\n",
    "\n",
    "With many iterative processes there is a need to get information **off** the device at regular intervals. Up to this point we have been transferring data off the compute device **after** kernel execution. Also, the routines to read information from device buffers have thus far been used in a blocking manner, that is the program **pauses** while the read occurs. Most compute devices have the ability to transfer data **while** kernels are being executed. This means IO transfers can take place during compute, and may in some instances **take place entirely** during kernel execution. For the cost of additional programming complexity, significant compute savings can be obtained, as the following diagram illustrates:\n",

    "## Concurrent IO is enabled with multiple command queues\n",
    "\n",
    "The **key to leveraging concurrent IO** is to have one command queue for the kernels and one or more command queues for moving data. Then IO operations can take place largely independently of the compute operations. OpenCL Events and the [clFinish](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenCL/sdk/3.0/docs/man/html/clFinish.html) command can help establish dependencies between and on command queues. Non-blocking IO calls may also help with concurrency."

    "#### Using Events to aid with concurrency\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to enable concurrent IO is to have an array of at least four OpenCL buffers. We choose an array of **nscratch=5** buffers to allow extra time for copies to finish. Associated with the buffers is an array of five command queues for IO and one command queue for compute. Every queued OpenCL operation can depend on a list of OpenCL Events and produce one OpenCL event. Therefore we also create an array of five Events to make sure that IO waits for the kernel execution to finish. A separate compute queue is used just for the kernel. \n",
    "\n",
    "We could of course either use command queues or events for synchronisation, however for teaching purposes we use a mix of both. During each iteration **n** of the time loop then:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use **[clFinish](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenCL/sdk/3.0/docs/man/html/clFinish.html)** waits for all activity on command_queue[(n+2)%nscratch] to complete.\n",
    "1. Submit the kernel to solve for U[(n+2)%nscratch], place an event at Events[n%nscratch]\n",
    "1. Use the command_queue[(n-1)%nscratch] to copy the buffer at U[(n-1)%nscratch] back to host, depend on Events[(n-1)%nscratch] to make sure the kernel has finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following diagram shows how the dependencies play out with events and command queues during a single iteration.\n",

    "In this module we explored how IO can take place at the same time as a kernel using multiple command queues. The concurrent IO solution was faster than the sequential IO solution. One does need to be careful that buffers are not being read or written at the same time as they are being used in a kernel, otherwise this leads to undefined behaviour. Events and the use of the **[clFinish](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenCL/sdk/3.0/docs/man/html/clFinish.html)** function can establish and enforce dependencies between activity that occurs across multiple command queues."
