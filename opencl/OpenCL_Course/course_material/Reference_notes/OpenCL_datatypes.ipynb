    "# OpenCL data types\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw in the survival C++ course that some C datatypes are represented with a nominal number of bits, depending on the platform and operating system in use. Within OpenCL kernels, a particular C datatype always uses the same number of bits, however in the main program that same C datatype might use a different number of bits. This is a problem for OpenCL applications which promise a level of portability across implementations. In order to remedy this, the latest [OpenCL C specification](https://www.khronos.org/registry/OpenCL/specs/3.0-unified/pdf/OpenCL_C.pdf) has a number of standard data types for fixing the number of bits used, and maintaining consistency with the number of bits used for types in the kernel. As follows is a number of commonly used OpenCL data types and how many bits they use. It is **good practice** to use these data types wherever practical in OpenCL applications."

    "\n",
    "In addition to the standard types above, the OpenCL standard also defines a number of vector types with **n** = 2,3,4,8, and 16 elements. Vectors can unlock performance within an OpenCL application because memory is loaded into caches using cache lines that are typically around 64-128 bytes (or 16-32 floats) wide. Furthermore, CPU's have SIMD units that can process, in one instruction, vectors of floats to 64 bytes long. Here are the vector types as used in both host and kernel code."
